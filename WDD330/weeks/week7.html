            THIS OBJECT METHODS:
            objects are usually created to represent entites in the real world like orders.
           

            a function that is a property of an object is a method
             </p>
             <p>
            method short hand 
            user = {
                sayHI() {
                    alert("hello");
                    }
                };
            
            omit "function"
            </p>
            <p>
            this is the current object
             this.name gets current object
            </p>
            <p>
            "this" works better to get the object.
            
            "this" can be used in any function if its not a method of an object
            
            ARROW FUNCTIONS HAVE NO "this"
            
            since it is taken from not a "normal" function and it won't work.
            </p>

            CSS ANIMATIONS
            </p>
            <p>
            css transitions 
            </p>
            <p>
            .animations {
                transition-property: background-color;
                transition-duration: 3s;
            }
            </p>
            <p>
            doing that changes the background color for 3 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
            4 properties in css transition: 
            
            "transition-"
            property,
            duration,
            timing-function,
            delay.
            <p>
            property can be written as a list of properties -left, margin-left, height, color. or all meaning all properties
            
            duration time in seconds or miliseconds.
            
            delay 1s or 2s makes it wait in 1 or 2 seconds.
            
            timing-function describes the process during the time line go slow then go fast or go fast then slow.
            </p>
            <p>
                bezier curve- 2 control points first (0,0) last (1,1) intbetween points can be anything.
                cubic-bezier(x2, y2, x3, y3).
            
                x axis is the time to the end of the transition duration.
                y axis specifies the completion of the process, start to final value.
                
                cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1) on a graph is a straigh line point A to point B.
                cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0) starts fast then goes slower.
                
                there is also other objects you could put in for the timing function we could use ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out. each doing there own prespective name.
            
                if we go out of the range y0 or y1 then the object will go further out of the quadrant it is assinged.
                </p>
                <p>
            STEPS: 
            
            steps(number of steps, start/end)
            when you do start it starts immediatly and when you do end it starts at the end of the first step
            </p>
            <p>
            TRANSITIONEND EVENT: 
            
            when css animation completes transitionend event triggers.
            generally it is used to do an action after the animation is complete or do another animation.
            
            event.propertyName can be good to animate multiple properties at the same time.
            
            event.elapsedTime the time in seconds it took without transition-delay property.
            </p>
            <p>
            KEYFRAMES: 
            
            using @keyframes you can join multiple animations together.
            
            you can create a key frame and use the same name on multiple occasions so you don't need to write the same lines of code over and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
            PERFORMANCE:
             
            when there is a style change the browser has 3 steps to process
            1 layout: change the position of the element
            2 paint: change how everything should look in thier respective places
            3 composite render everything and add css transforms
            </p>
            <p>
            the more you have with the animations the slower it can become
            so skipping the paint step will help it run more smooth
            </p>
            <p>
            transform goes on top of the existing layout and paint calculations
            </p>
            <p>
            using transform is a powerful property and don't trigger the first two steps. you can flip, rotate, stretch, shrink, move, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            transform: scale to change the size of the element
            </p>
            <p>
            opacity property also doesn't trigger layout and it can be used to show/hide or fade in/out effects.
            </p>
            <p>
            using both transform and opacity can be a good use for getting good looking and smooth animations
