        <p>
            FETCH:
            Javascript can send network requests and recieve new info.
            
            it can load user info, submit an order, get updates, etc.
         </p>
         <p>   
            AJAX(asycnhronos Javascript and XML):
            fetch() is a good way to send and recieve information from the server
            </p>
            <p>
            Example: let promise = fetch(URL, [parameter, methods etc.]);
            
            getting a response has 2 steps to it 
            1. the promise, returned by fetch, resolves with an object with response class as soon as the server responds
            
            checks to see if fetch worked. 
            example
            let response = await.fetch(url);
            
            if (response.ok) {
                let json = await response.json();
            }
            else {
            alert("HTTP-Error: " + response.status);
            }
            
            2 use a method to get the response body
            
            response.text() read the response and returns as text
            response.json() returns the response as JSON
            response.formData() returns as FormData
            response.blob() returns as blob (binary data with type)
            response.arrayBuffer() returns low level representation of binary data
            
            
            let commits = await response.json();
            
            alert(commits[0].author.login);
            
            or without await
            
            fetch("https....)
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(commits => alert(commits[0].author.login))
            </p>
            <p>
            RESPONSE HEADERS:
            the response headers are like Map headers in (response.headers)
            </p>
            <p>
            REQUEST HEADERS:
            headers is an object with ongoing headers.
            example
            let response = fetch(protectedURL, {
                headers: {
                    authentication: "secret"
                }
            });
            </p>
            <p>
            POST REQUEST:
            post can be used to submit data.
            to make a POST request we need to use fetch options:
                method: HTTP-method POST
                body: requests the body of string, formdata, blob
            
            
            let respose = await fetch("/article...", {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=utf-8"
                },
                body: JSON.stringify(user)
            });
            </p>
            <p>
            SENDING AN IMAGE:
            using binary with fetch to save an image.
            </p>
            <p>
                SUMMARY:
            fetch usually has 2 await calls.
            let response = await fetch(url, options); // resolves with response headers
            let result = await response.json(); // read body as json
            
            or 
            
            2 .then calls
            
            Exampe
            fetch(url, options)
              .then(response => response.json())
              .then(result => /* process result */)
            
            </p>
            <p>
                
            FETCH: CROSS ORIGIN REQUESTS:
            
            If we send a fetch request to another website it will most likely fail.
            
            CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
            you can share information as long as both sides agree
            </p>
            <p>
            SAFE REQUEST:
            1 Safe method: GET, POST, HEAD
            2 Safe headers: accept, accept-Language, Content-Language, content-Type
            
            Safe requests can be made with form or script without any special methods.
            
            Javascript -> fetch() -> Browser -> HTTP-Request -> Server -> HTTP-response -> Browser -> allows or fails -> Javascript
            </p>
            <p>
               UNSAFE REQUESTS:
            "preflight" request asks for permission 
            OPTIONS no body and 3 headers
            ACCESS-CONTROL-REQUEST-METHOD: header has the method of unsafe request
            ACCESS-CONTROL-REQUEST-HEADERS: provides a comma-seperated list of unsafe HTTP-headers
            ORIGIN: header tells where request came from.
            
            if server agrees to request it will send status 200 and headers
            ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-ORGIN: must be a "*" or the requesting origin.
            ACCESS-CONTOL-ALLOW-METHODS: must have the allowed method.
            ACCESS-CONTROL-ALLOW-HEADERS: must have a list of allowed headers
            
            </p>
            <p>
            REST PARAMETERS AND SPREAD SYNTAX:
            
            REST PARAMETERS "..." :
            
            a function can be called with any number of arguments no matter how it is defined.
            
            "..." folowed by the name of the array that will contain them means to get remaining parameters in an array.
            
            function calculateTotal(...Numbers) {
            // calculate total
            }
            
            you can choose to get the first parameters and gather the rest
            
            example 
            function showName(firstName, lastName, ...titles) {
            // gets first name and last name everything else goes into titles array
            }
            </p>
            <p>
            SPREAD SYNTAX:
            
            Opposite of getting an array from list.
            Array.from because it converts it into an array
            
            let arrCopy = [...arr];
            
            or 
            
            let objCopy = {...obj};
            
            </p>
            <p>
            HOW SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS WORK:
            
            Single page applications use state from url location or track internally
            location base SPA can share link that will work when you click on said link
            
            window.location can interact with different parts of url without parse it yourself
            
            only 3 of the location objects are imprtant pathname, hash, and search
            
            /images?of=mountains
            </p>
            <p>
            HOW BROWSERS HANDLE LOCATIONS:
            
            the browsing context maintains a session history.
            document describes the page
            while you are clicking links and navigating through pages the brower is building up a session history.
            
            clicking the back button on the browser will make a current entry (current.index - 1);
            
            pushState(null, "", "/next-location") and replaceState(null, "", "/replace-location")
                  State, title, path				State, title, path
            path can be locally or a URL if you want too.
            
            history.pushState() adds an entry to the session history after the current entry
            history.replaceState() replaces the current entry in the session.
            
            go() is like the browser forward and back buttons
            
            go(-1);  go back one entry
            go(1);  go forward one entry
            go(-10);  go way back
            go(0);  reload
            go(); reload
            </p>
            <p>
            
            PROBLEM WITH SINGLE PAGE APPS:
            
            routing is a way to show the layout of the page
            
            SPA serve all the code from a single index.html file
            
            using JavaScript to handle URL rounting STEPS
            1. configure everything to point back to index.html
            2. Supress the default behavior when someone clicks a link that points to another page in the app
            3. Use more Javascript history.pushState() to update URL without making the page reload
            4. match url agains a map of routes and serve right content based on it
            5. if URL has variable info in it parse that data out of RL.
            6. when someone clicks the browsers forward or backward button update url and ui
            7. update title on element page
            8. use more javascript to dynamically focus the content area when the content changes.
            
            that is a lot of javascript and is fragile but you could use a multipage for similar or better results
            </p>
            <p>
            WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN USING JAVASCRIPT ROUTING?
            
            1. supports browsers forward and back buttons 
            2. don't need to intercept clicks it just does it itself.
            3. you don't need to use complex regex patterns or another library to parse URL
            4. it is simpler and easier to implement
