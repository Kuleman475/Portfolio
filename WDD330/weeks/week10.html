        <h3>Week 10 Notes</h3>

<p>       

Javascript the Hard parts:
</p> 
<p> 
callbacks and higher order functions:
</p> 
<p> 
create a function takes no input (useless functions)
</p> 
<p> 
set a parameter to take input to put into a function. 
</p> 
<p> 
global memory
first line define function
second line declare a variable
third line result
</p> 
<p> 
that is an execution context
</p> 
<p> 
local memory
</p> 
<p> array: values
</p> 
<p> declare an output 
</p> 
<p> 
take array and make it into a for loop
</p> 
<p> 
we could generalizre the function to be able to pass in specific function, example +5, /4, -8, etc.
</p> 
<p> 
you can put functions inside of function parameters
example function nameAndAge(name, age){}
	function age(){}
</p> 
<p> 
call stack calls and uses a function that is inside the function parameter to get that to send it to the next function to be able to use the results from that function.
</p> 
<p> 
functions in javascript = first class objects
</p> 
<p> 
they have all the properties of objects. they van be assigned to variables, then passed as arguments into functions, returned as values from functions.
</p> 
<p> 
higher order functions is the outer function. functions that are passed in are callback functions.
</p>
