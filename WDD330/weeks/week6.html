    </p>
    <ul>
<li>    let form = document.forms.formName</li>
<li>    let result = form.elements.age</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    if multiple components have the same name then you can do
    </p>
    <ul>
<li>    let form = document.forms[1];</li>
<li>    let age = form.elements.age;</li>

    FORMS: EVENT AND METHOD SUBMIT
    
    2 Ways to submit a form
    
    1. click <input type="submit">
    2. push Enter on an input field.
    
    both actions submit the form
    </p>
    <p>
    METHOD: SUBMIT:
    form.submit()
    
    using the form.subimt manually creates and submits a form
    </p>
    <p>    
    CLIENT-SIDE FORM VALIDATION:
    
    is the initial validation to check so the user can fix right away.
    if not used it gets to the server and then takes some time to come back with the errors.
    
    you should ALWAYS do security checks on server and client side just to be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
    WHAT IS FORM VALIDATION:
     
    form validation is making sure you provide the data that is needed
    example you don't feel out a field and it is required and shows a message or something saying something is wrong with the field whether that be not filled out correctly or at all.
    like when filling out a password and you have to use a number and capital letters it needs to meet all the requirements.
    
    form validation is the thing that checks all the form data to make sure it is correct.
    
    built in form validation uses HTML form validation features. has better performance than javascript but not as customizable.
    javaScript validation is coded using Javascript but you'll need to write it out yourself or use a library. 
    </p>
    <p>
    BUILT IN FORM VALIDATION:
    
    can validate most user data without javaScript.
    it validates the attributes on the form elements
    
    when the element is valid it matches with CSS class
    also it will send to the browser unless something else is stopping it.
    </p>
    <p>
    REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE: 
    when you have the required attribute set it needs to be filled out in order for it to be sent
    </p>
    <p>
    validating against a regular expression:
    regexp is a pattern that can ve used to match character combinations in text strings.
    
    example pattern = [Bb]anana;
    
    minlength and maxlength;
    
    min length means it has to have at least a certain amount of characters while max length has to be under the max length of characters; 
    
    number would have a max="x" and min="y" since it is a number you would put a number for x and y.
    </p>
    <p>
    VALIDATING USING JAVASCRIPT:
    
    HTMLButtonElement
    HTMLInputElement
    etc.
    
    validationMessage: returns a localized message describing what isn't correct in the validation
    validity: returns a validityState which describes the state which it is in
    
    automated error message has 2 drawbacks 
    1 no way to change the look and feel with CSS
    2 depend on browser locale which means you can have the page be in one language and the error message in another.
    
    </p>
    <p>
    USING FORM DATA OBJECTS EFFECTIVELY:
    
    form needs an ID in order to get form objects.
    needs to have "name" attribute
    prevenDefault(); stops page from loading. 
    create a new for using new FormData(FormName)
    
    use append method to add into form
    network tab will show the form data
    
    let myform = ev.target;
    let fd = new FormData(myForm) those lines got it to submit and send 
    
    convert form to data to a string using JSON.stringify(fd)
