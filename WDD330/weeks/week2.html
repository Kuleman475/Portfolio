        <p>Learned about github branches as well as practiced working with them.</p>

        <p>we each completed our first trello card.</p>
        
        <h3>Week 2 Notes</h3>

        <p>It was a good refresher on how to do JavaScript since I haven't used JavaScript in quite a while, so it was good to see how it is written again. As well as what entails in the language. 
        You can also add things to a list using JavaScript. You can also store stuff using JavaScript which is pretty cool.</p>
