        <p>It was a good refresher on how to do JavaScript since I havenâ€™t used JavaScript in quite a while, so it was good to see how it is written again. As well as what entails in the language. 
        You can also add things to a list using JavaScript. You can also store stuff using JavaScript which is pretty cool.</p>
