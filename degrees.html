        <p>Introduction to databases: "This course covers the basic elements of database management systems. It introduces students to the concepts of logical and physical relationships in a data model and the concepts of inner and outer joins. Students will use a computer aided software engineering (CASE) tool to design, create, and query a database." -class overview</p>
        <p>Introduction to programming: "This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of computers and information technology. Students will learn the basics of computer hardware and the binary and hexadecimal number systems, design algorithms to solve simple computing problems, and will write computer programs using Boolean logic, control structures, and functions." -class overview</p>
        <p>Web Frontend Development 1: "This course focuses on the planning and development of responsive web sites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with attention to usability principles." -class overview</p>
        <p>Networking: "This course teaches general networking principles to provide an understanding of data communication protocols, transmission systems, media, and software." -class overview</p>
        <p>Object Oriented Programming: "This course is an introduction to object oriented programming using the Java programming language. Students will write computer programs using primitive data types, control structures, Java Swing classes, and objects. Students will read and draw UML class diagrams and will use Java swing to write programs with a graphical user interface." -class overview</p>
